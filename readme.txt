You can download the data by run the script in "./data" folder for corresponding datasets.

To run the cross-client contrastive learning, you can go to the "cross-client-contrastive/contrastive_learning" folder and run the program with the help of readme file.

To run the feature extraction, you can go to the "cross-client-contrastive/feature_extraction" folder and run the program with the help of readme file.

To run the DDE active learning system, you can go to the "active-learning-DDE/sampling" folder and run the program with the help of readme file.

To reproduce the performance, you can go to the "active-learning-DDE/al_fed" folder and run the program with the help of readme file.

For convenience, we prepare the model weights, extracted features and sampling results 
so that you can reproduce the performance by just go to "active-learning-DDE/al_fed" folder and run the program.
